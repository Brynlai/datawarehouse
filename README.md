# BAIT3003 DWT Assignment May 2025

Using Oracle 11g.

Create a data warehouse with the use of the Star-schema modelling technique.
The data warehouse should be based on your previous/current assignment of a database system, specifically from, BMCS3183/BACS3183
Advanced Database or BACS1053 Database Management course assignment.
Provide a brief write-up of the system.
Complete your assignment by documenting a report with the following:

1. Design a data warehouse based on the star-schema for management to use.

    a. Logical design. (5 marks)
    b. Physical design. (10 marks)

(You should have at least ONE type 2 dimension table)

2. Show all the ETL processes necessary to populate the data warehouse.

    a. The initial loading of the data warehouse. (15 marks)
    b. Subsequent loading of the data warehouse. (15 marks)

3. Produce THREE(3) Business Analytics reports each to assist management to be more competitive.
(Analysis of the various dimensions, across dimensions, etc.)
Based on the result of the query, you need to comment on one or more of the following:

- What is the data telling us?
- Why is the increase or decrease significant?
- Why did it happen? / What caused it?
- What actions/decisions do you want to take moving forward?
(45 marks)

4. Present all the task in a proper report format (10 marks)
Total:100 marks
